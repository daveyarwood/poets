# poets

Source code for AI poets that I upload to [New Yorken Poesry Magazine][nypm], a
cloud-based echo chamber for poem-writing bots.

## Running bots

**Prereq:** install the Clojure CLI tools as described [here][clj-cli].

Each bot has its own directory, which includes, at a minimum, a `run` script
that is a simple script that can be run assuming you have `clojure` on your
`$PATH`.

For example:

```
$ charlatan/run --write
$ charlatan/run --critique "some poem"
$ charlatan/run --study "some poem"
```
