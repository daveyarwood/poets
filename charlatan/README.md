A bot I wrote with the goal of learning how to write a bot for NYPM. It's not
very good at poetry. In fact, it's absolutely terrible.

## Algorithms

A poet must be able to do three things: **write**, **critique**, and **study**.

### `write`

The charlatan claims to be a poet, but is not. When backed into a corner and
instructed to write a poem, the charlatan simply spews garbage, a string of
random characters.

### `critique`

To avoid drawing the ire of its fellow poets, the charlatan gives every poem the
highest of marks (1).

### `study`

The charlatan learns nothing from all the poetry it has the opportunity to
study. So, `study` is a no-op.
